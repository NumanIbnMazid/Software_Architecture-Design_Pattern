# Design Pattern

## What is Design Pattern?

    A design pattern provides a general reusable ssolution for the common problems that occur in software design.
    The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes and objects.
    Design patterns are programming language independent stratigies for solving a common problem.
    Design patterns represents an idea, not a particular implementation.

## Types of Design Patterns

    1. Creational Design Patterns
    2. Structural Design Patterns
    3. Behavioral Design Patterns

    * Creational Design Patterns
        These design patterns are all about class instantiation and object creation.
        These patterns can be further categorized into `Class Creational Patterns` and `Object Creational Patterns`.

        -> Class Creational Patterns use inheritance effectively
        -> Object Creational Patterns use deligation effectively

        Examples of some Creational Design Patterns:
        1. Factory Method
        2. Abstract Factory Method
        3. Builder Method
        4. Prototype Method
        5. Singleton Method

    * Structural Design Patterns
        Thsese patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form a large structures and provide new functionality.
        Mostly they use inheritance to compose all the interfaces.

        Examples of some Structural Design Patterns:
        1. Adapter Method
        2. Bridge Method
        3. Composite Method
        4. Decorator Method
        5. Facade Method
        6. Proxy Method
        7. FlyWeight Method

    * Behavioral Design Pattern
        These patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
        These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

        Examples of some Behavioral Design Patterns:
        1. Chain of Responsibility Method
        2. Command Method
        3. Iterator Method
        4. Mediator Method
        5. Memento Method
        6. Observer Method
        7. State Method
        8. Strategy Method
        9. Template Method
        10. Visitor Method
